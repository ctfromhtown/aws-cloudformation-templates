# AWS CloudFormation Sample Templates

This repository contains sample CloudFormation templates that I have used for personal or professional purposes.

Some templates originated from [aws-cloudformation-templates](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-templates)

You can use to help you get started on new infrastructure projects. Keep in mind that these 
templates are not meant to be production-ready "QuickStarts". You should 
take the time to learn how they work, adapt them to your needs, and make sure
that they meet your company's compliance standards.

Each template in this repository passes
[CloudFormation Linter](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-lint)
(cfn-lint) checks, and also a basic set of
[CloudFormation Guard](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard)
 rules based on the CIS Top 20, with exceptions for some rules where it
made sense to keep the sample focused on a single use case.
